                <p>
                    I call you <strong>Abaye</strong>, not just because you're my father, but because you're my strength, my first protector, and my greatest teacher.
                    From the very beginning, you carried me with love, with patience, and with a strength only a father can understand. I remember you lying on your stomach just to play with me, to wipe my tears and clean my dirt without hesitation. 
                    You washed my clothes when I was helpless, you stood by me when I didn’t even know how to stand for myself. And even now, when I’m older, you still overcarry me—with your care, your worry, and your unconditional love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are my silent supporter, my quiet warrior. You sacrificed your comfort to build mine. You put your dreams aside to make room for mine. And even when life was hard, you smiled at me like everything was okay, because you wanted me to grow in love, not fear.
                    I know there’s nothing I could ever do that could truly repay you—but I dream. I dream of the day I will raise you to a place of peace and honor, where you’ll finally rest, and I will tell you: "Abaye, I got you now—just like you had me when I had nothing."
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are the reason I believe in love that asks for nothing in return. You are my first example of sacrifice, of strength, of true manhood. I love you with everything I have, and everything I will become is because you never stopped believing in me.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Love you forever, Abaye. ❤️</strong>
