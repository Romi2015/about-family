                <h2>My Emaye â€” My Heart, My Home ðŸ’–</h2>
                <p>
                    I call you <strong>Emaye</strong>, not just because you're my mom, but because you're the soul I always return to. From the moment I began to speak, you were the one I shared everything with. My little secrets, my silly stories â€” even when I said them a hundred times, you smiled like you were hearing them for the first time. 
                    Your patience is not human, it's divine. Your love doesnâ€™t question, doesnâ€™t condition â€” it just stays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For nine long months, you carried me with love, with pain, with dreams â€” while lying on your side, and your back, just to protect the life inside you. And then, you brought me into this world, not just through your body, but through your soul. 
                    You gave me your strength when I had none. You let me rest while you stayed awake. You fed me even when you were hungry. You clothed me while you went cold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Emaye, sometimes I see your eyes tired, your body in pain, and still you hide it. You smile to protect me from your suffering. I get scared â€” what if I canâ€™t repay you? What if I canâ€™t give you the life you always deserved? I beg God every night: 
                    <em>"Please, let them live until I can give them what they gave me. Let me raise them the way they raised me."</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are the first heartbeat I ever heard. You are my comfort, my warmth, my home in every storm. You are the reason I know what love means. There is no treasure greater than you, Emaye. I love you beyond words, beyond this life.
                    <br><br>
                    Thank you for never giving up on me. I pray that one day, Iâ€™ll put you in the place where you always belonged â€” high, honored, loved, protected. <br><strong>I love you forever, Emaye. ðŸ’–</strong>
